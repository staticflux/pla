# phpLiteAdmin 2.0.0
## PHP 8.0.0 (or better)
This goal behind this is to make a version of [phpLiteAdmin](https://www.phpliteadmin.org) that works on a modern version of PHP. In our case that version is [PHP 8.0.0](https://www.php.net/releases/8.0/) and above.

## Bootstrap
The theaming for phpLiteAdmin 2.0.0 will be based on [Bootstrap Version 5](https://getbootstrap.com).

## PHP Standalone Server
You can use this web application with just PHP by using the [built in web server](https://www.php.net/manual/en/features.commandline.webserver.php). From this directory run `php -S 0.0.0.0:8080` and goto [`localhost:8080/phpLiteAdmin.php`](http://localhost:8080/phpLiteAdmin.php).
